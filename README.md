ðŸš€ Excited to share a recent project! I've just completed a Netflix clone website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. ðŸŽ¬âœ¨

This project was an incredible learning experience, allowing me to dive deep into web development and hone my skills in front-end technologies. From designing a sleek, user-friendly interface to implementing dynamic content and responsive features, this project has been both challenging and rewarding.
